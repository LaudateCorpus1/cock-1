now:

- task selection in sidebar (which will replace the "currently working task")

  the tl;dr of this one is that i want to be able to express that i went to do something else
  instead of the ideal day, so i have a more accurate "current day" representation

  i click on the task in the sidebar, and the "currently working on task" becomes that task
  where i can mark it as completed and shit

next up:

- mobile view

  if i'm on mobile, maybe don't show the bars but the current task and the buttons?

later:

- configuration in webapp

  have a UI for creating tasks, setting sleep time, and setting up the ideal day

- saving of historical data

  so you can look back at previous days
  we'll basically save the entire state tree for individual days

- historical view
  where we view stored task bars day-aligned

- ideal adjusted view
  we can have a rudimentary task where only the long breaks are shortened (and the ideal bar grows longer over time)
    this will mean we'll probably break up short breaks and long breaks into separate tasks?

  ideal day in config should mark which tasks are important (maybe in order of importance?)
  non-important tasks get shrunk first (emptyTask, then longest tasks not marked as unshrinkable)

  there will be a point where there is really no ideal view (since you have wasted so much time),
  how do we render that?
    how do we mark the tasks that we must do no matter what? does adjusted ideal bleed past 24 hours?

- historical view in the same view as the wake bar views
  tl;dr i want to make wake bars (ideal, adj. ideal, current) day-aligned, rather than wake-aligned

  how do we handle scenarios where you stay up longer than expected? how does that get rendered?

- x factor
  keep track of which tasks we do that should be kept track of per-day on a calendar view

- ideal days (per week)

- calendar tasks

- a "so far" timer that shows how much time you spent overall in the day

- a breakdown of same tasks (and how much time they overall take in the ideal day)

- adding notes for a day, so you know what happened when (if anything was funky)

- ???
