- better format for config
  basically, think the task stuff though, maybe we should create a TaskManager or something
  idk yet

- historical view
  where we view stored task bars day-aligned

- ideal adjusted view
  ideal day in config should mark which tasks are important (maybe in order of importance?)
  non-important tasks get shrunk first (emptyTask, then longest tasks not marked as unshrinkable)

  there will be a point where there is really no ideal view (since you have wasted so much time),
  how do we render that?
    how do we mark the tasks that we must do no matter what? does adjusted ideal bleed past 24 hours?

- historical view in the same view as the wake bar views
  tl;dr i want to make wake bars (ideal, adj. ideal, current) day-aligned, rather than wake-aligned

  how do we handle scenarios where you stay up longer than expected? how does that get rendered?

- x factor
  keep track of which tasks we do that should be kept track of per-day on a calendar view

- ideal days (per week)

- calendar tasks

- ???
